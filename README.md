## Singleton Pattern

### What is Singleton Class
-   Singleton means one i.e. Only one instance of the class can be created

### Steps to create a Singleton Class: 
- In the SingletonService class we can see for class Abc() a static instance object (obj) is created for that class
- For that class the default constructor is made private ,so that no object can be created for that class
-  After that, static method (getInstance()) is created for that class which will return the object(obj) of Abc
